#  Introduction to Linux System Programming

**Linux System Programming** is a branch of programming that deals with interacting directly with the **Linux operating system's core services**, using **system calls and low-level APIs** provided by the **Linux kernel**.

##  What is System Programming?

System programming involves writing programs that provide services to the computer's hardware and software. In Linux, this includes:

- File handling  
- Process management  
- Memory management  
- Inter-process communication (IPC)  
- Threading  
- Networking  
- Signals

##  Key Components of Linux System Programming

| Component            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Calls**      | Interface between user programs and the Linux kernel (e.g., `open()`, `read()`, `write()`). |
| **File I/O**          | Low-level operations on files using system calls.                          |
| **Process Control**   | Creating and managing processes (`fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()` etc.).       |
| **Memory Management** | Allocating and freeing memory (`malloc()`, `mmap()`, `brk()` etc.).        |
| **Signals**           | Handling asynchronous events like `SIGINT`, `SIGKILL`, etc.                |
| **IPC**               | Mechanisms like pipes, message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.      |
| **Threading**         | Using POSIX threads (`pthread`) to manage concurrency.                     |
| **Device Access**     | Accessing and controlling hardware devices via files in `/dev/`.           |

##  Why Learn Linux System Programming?

- To **build powerful applications** like shells, daemons, file systems, and servers.  
- Understand how **Linux works internally**.  
- Write **efficient low-level code** for performance-critical applications.  
- Essential for careers in **Embedded Systems**, **Operating Systems**, **Kernel Development**, and **DevOps**.
