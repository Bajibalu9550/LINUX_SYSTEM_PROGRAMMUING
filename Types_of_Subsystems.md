# Types of Subsystems

The complete Linux system is divided into five subsystems:

1. **Process Management Subsystem**
2. **File Management Subsystem**
3. **Device/Driver Management Subsystem**
4. **Memory Management Subsystem**
5. **Network Management Subsystem**

There is a single program which controls all the subsystems: **the Linux kernel**

- **Process Management** is responsible for executing the processes.
- **File Management** is responsible for performing and handling file operations.
- **Device Management** is responsible for handling all peripherals, devices, and drivers.
- **Memory Management** is responsible for allocating memory.
- **Network Management Subsystem (NMS)** plays a key role in monitoring, configuring, and maintaining network interfaces and connections using tools, services, and daemons built into the system.
